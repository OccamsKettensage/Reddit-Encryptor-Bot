# Reddit-Encryptor-Bot
A reddit bot that can encrypt comments on reddit when called. Uses the RSA technique for encryption.

Written in Python, this bot can encrypt comments on reddit when called. While this bot can work throughout reddit, I have 
currently limited its reach to the testing subreddit (reddit.com/r/test).
Link to the bot: reddit.com/u/Vibhanshu3 

To call the bot, comment:

Encrypt: <your message>

And the bot will reply with the encrypted message.

You can run the bot yourself. I can't run the bot all the time because I need to shut down my laptop; I am figuring out a way to make 
it run without depending on me.

However, if you want to see the bot in action, send me a message and I'll run it for you. When the bot is running, it can encrypt comments
as soon as they're made because it refreshes list of comments every minute.
